*Algeria* is a North African country with a coastline on the Mediterranean Sea and a desert interior, the Sahara. Many empires have left their mark here, such as the ancient Roman ruins of Tipasa, by the sea. In the capital, Algiers, Ottoman sites, such as the Ketchaoua Mosque, dating from around 1612, line the Casbah district. Perched on a hill, this place has narrow walkways and stairs. The Notre-Dame d'Afrique basilica, featuring neo-Byzantine architecture, dates from French colonial rule.
